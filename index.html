      <img class="img-fluid" src="/assets/img/1.png" />
      <p class="mt-4">
        The rice fields of Bali are iconic, and Tegallalang Rice Terrace near Ubud is considered THE rice field to add to your Bali itinerary. The UNESCO World Heritage site offers sweeping views of the tiered rice fields and valleys, and
        extraordinary scenery if you walk through the trails themselves. You can also see the local farmers in action and learn more about Bali’s unique irrigation system that’s been passed down through generations from the 8th century.
        Given its aesthetic appeal and the fun of activities like the giant swing and zipline, Tegallalang is one of the best rice terraces in Bali. While you’re there, you can also visit the traditional village, shop at the local markets,
        and even visit the coffee plantation.

      <h3>4. Campuhan Ridge</h3>
      <img class="img-fluid" src="/assets/img/3.png" />
      <p class="mt-4">
        Not all hillside hikes in Bali have to come with maximum physical exertion. The 2km Campuhan Ridge Walk famously combines stunning views of verdant scenery, and is one of Ubud’s best attractions. The Ayung River and Mount Agung in
        the distance and a mostly-flat path that’s not very strenuous. Arrive early in the morning for golden lighting and fewer crowds.

      <h3>5. Mount Batur</h3>
      <img class="img-fluid" src="/assets/img/5.png" />
      <p class="mt-5">
        Did you have ‘hike an active volcano’ on your Bali bucket list? If not, you’ll be very happy to add a trek up Mount Batur to your itinerary. Mount Batur is one of two active volcanoes in Bali (the other is Mount Agung) that offers
        visitors adventure and epic views in one, cardio-intense activity. Sitting roughly 1,717 metres above sea level in the Kintamani highlands, the summit of Mount Batur offers breathtaking views of Bali’s unique landscape, including
        the lush countryside and Lake Batur. It's worth noting that the hike is most suitable for those with moderate fitness levels to tackle the rocky and sometimes steep terrain, and the best way to hike Mount Batur is with a local guide
        who can help you navigate the trek. It's also worth noting that it's better to tackle the trek in the dry season (May - October), when Bali's weather is clearer, a little cooler, and there's less chance of rain to muddy the hike.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Opening Hours:</strong> No specified opening hours, but hikes often start early in the morning.</p>
      <p><strong>Cost of entry:</strong> There is no entry free to hike Mount Batur, but tour and guide costs will vary from operator to operator.</p>

      <img class="img-fluid" src="/assets/img/6.png" />
      <p class="mt-5">
        Located just outside of Ubud, Goa Gajah Elephant Cave is an enchanting Hindu temple complex that dates back to the 9th century. This is a great place to bring little ones – wander through ornate carvings on the rock walls, explore
        hidden chambers, and admire the beautiful elephant statue that guards the entrance. Remember to bring a sarong so that no one out the front will bother you with offers to sell you one.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Opening Hours:</strong> 8am - 5pm for visitors, and 24 hours for worship</p>

      <p><strong>Cost of entry:</strong></p>
      <p>Children: IDR 25,000 (~AUD$2.50)</p>
      <p>Adults: IDR 50,000 (~AUD$5)</p>

      <h3>7. Kecak dance at Uluwatu Temple</h3>
      <img class="img-fluid" src="/assets/img/7.png" />
      <p class="mt-5">
        One of Bali's most popular attractions is the Kecak dance, a traditional Balinese dance performed by male dancers in intricate costumes. For the ultimate Kecak dance experience, we recommend visiting Uluwatu Temple, a 1,000-year-old
        temple perched on a 70-meter cliff overlooking the Indian Ocean. This temple is considered one of the six key temples in Bali that are believed to be the island's spiritual pillars. The dance is usually performed during sunset,
        providing a breathtaking view of the temple and ocean. Despite the crowds, witnessing the Kecak dance is an unforgettable experience due to its cultural significance and stunning performance, so we highly recommend making the
        effort.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Opening Hours:</strong> Daily, 7am – 6pm</p>

      <p><strong>Cost of entry:</strong></p>

      <h3>8. Tirta Empul Temple</h3>
      <img class="img-fluid" src="/assets/img/8.png" />
      <p class="mt-5">
        A few nights of experiencing Bali’s party scene will have you itching to visit the Tirta Empul Temple, a sacred Hindu temple in the village of Manukaya that’s famous for its holy spring water that’s believed to heal and purify.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Tirta Empul Temple complex is big – roughly 1.65 hectares – and while it’s most famous for its pool and the traditional purification ritual of bathing in the holy spring water (known as 'melukat’), it’s worth wandering through
        the courtyards and gardens to see the traditional Balinese and Hindu statues and shrines – each with their own intricate designs and embellishments. You can also visit the museum to view the collection of traditional Balinese art
        and culture.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Opening Hours:</strong> Daily, 8am – 6pm</p>

      <p><strong>Cost of entry:</strong> Children: IDR 50,000 (~AUD$5)</p>

      <h3>9. Nusa Penida Day Trip</h3>
      <img class="img-fluid" src="/assets/img/9.png" />
      <p class="mt-5">
        While you could never tire of Bali’s pristine beaches and clear waters, a day trip to the nearby island of Nusa Penida is worth the effort of ditching your sun lounger for the day. Nusa Penida is a relatively large, mostly
        undeveloped island that’s situated about 20km off the south coast of Bali, and is famous for diving and snorkelling - especially to see the famous Manta Rays and Mola Mola fish - as well as its beautiful tropical beaches, dramatic
        cliffs, and lush greenery.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Opening Hours:</strong> Nusa Penida itself doesn’t have opening hours, but it’s important to note the times for when boats arrive and depart the harbour – typically from 7:30am – 5pm. Check individual operators for
        schedules.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Cost of entry:</strong></p>
      <p>Children: IDR 15,000 (~AUD$1.50)</p>
      <p>Adults: IDR 20,000 (~AUD$2)</p>

      <h3>10. Quad Bike & Whitewater Rafting Day Trip</h3>
      <img class="img-fluid" src="/assets/img/10.png" />
      <p class="mt-5">Adrenaline junkies who can't decide between quad biking and whitewater rafting in Bali, why not do both?</p>
      <p>
        Before you think you’ll be spending a day on a quad bike while whitewater rafting, you’ll be pleased (or perhaps disappointed) to know that the day trip is divided into two parts, usually around two hours each, with a lunch break in
        between. Which activity comes first will depend on your tour of choice, but expect a heart-pumping day to take in Bali's incredible landscape.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Opening Hours:</strong> Tours will usually start around 7:30am for pickup (later if you’re closer to Ubud), and you’ll typically be back at your accommodation around 5pm.</p>

      <p><strong>Cost of entry:</strong> Tour prices will vary based on availability and the operator.</p>

      <h1>Top 10 Things to Do - Activities</h1>
      <h3>1. Hit the Beach</h3>
      <img class="img-fluid" src="/assets/img/11.png" />
      <p class="mt-4">Often described as an island paradise, Bali has more than 70 beaches on its coast - each with their own unique charms and natural features.</p>
      <p>Padang Padang, Kelingking and Sanur are three of the best beaches in Bali.</p>
      <h4>Padang Padang</h4>
      <p>
        Uluwatu’s Padang Padang Beach is a surfer’s paradise thanks to its powerful waves and consistent surfing conditions, but it’s a must for beachgoers, too. The small, sheltered bay is surrounded by cliffs and greenery, offering a
        sense of seclusion and serenity. Walking through the narrow staircase to the golden sand and turquoise waters feels like you’ve discovered something truly special.
      </p>
      <h4>Sanur beach</h4>
      <p>
        The 7km of white sand of Sanur Beach on Bali’s southeastern coast is a haven for families – or even those looking for tranquil waters for swimming, snorkelling or stand-up paddleboarding. It’s easy to snorkel offshore, and you can
        rent snorkelling gear from one of the vendors on the beach. Join a guided tour if you want to explore the marine life at nearby reefs!
      </p>
      <h4>Kelingking beach</h4>
      <p>
        Make your way to Nusa Penida’s Kelingking Beach for one of the best views you can get in Bali – the T-Rex shaped rock formation, surrounded by clear turquoise waters. The trek down to the beach can be rocky and steep, so it’s best
        for those who are moderately fit and one to tackle without the kids.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="container-fluid oke mt-5" style="width: 40%">
      <h3>2. Chase waterfalls</h3>
      <img class="img-fluid" src="/assets/img/12.png" />
      <p class="mt-4">
        Visiting Bali's waterfalls is a must for any nature enthusiast or adventure seeker. There are more than 200 waterfalls to choose from, each with their own breathtaking scenery that provides a serene escape from the bustle of Bali’s
        towns.
      </p>
      <p>Git Git, Sekumpul and Tegenungan are three of the best waterfalls in Bali.</p>
      <h4>Gitgit Waterfall</h4>
      <p>
        Surrounded by lush tropical forest, Gitgit Waterfall is an awe-inspiring sight, cascading down over 35 meters. Despite its impressive size and beauty, the waterfall is easily accessible via a well-marked 15-minute walk. Visitors can
        take a dip in the refreshing swimming pool at the bottom and explore nearby smaller waterfalls.
      </p>
      <h4>Sekumpul Waterfall</h4>
      <p>
        Sekumpul Waterfall is the tallest waterfall in Bali, with seven levels that offer breathtaking views of the surrounding jungle. The trek through dense jungle and across rivers provides a thrilling adventure, and you’ll be rewarded
        with majestic views. Located 2.5-3 hours north of central towns like Ubud, it's well worth the effort to get to what is considered Bali’s best waterfall.
      </p>
      <h4>Tegenungan Waterfall</h4>
      <p>
        Only half an hour away from Ubud, Tegenungan Waterfall cascades into a plunge pool and is surrounded by lush green jungle, providing a tranquil and serene atmosphere for visitors. The local village of Tegenungan Kemenuh and nearby
        temples offer a deeper cultural experience. Additionally, the Omma Dayclub offers cocktails and food against a picturesque backdrop.
      </p>

    <div class="container-fluid oke mt-5" style="width: 40%">
      <h3>3. Snorkel or dive</h3>
      <img class="img-fluid" src="/assets/img/13.png" />
      <p class="mt-4">
        Exploring Bali's diverse and vibrant underwater world is an unforgettable experience. With its crystal clear and year-round warm water, Bali is home to 500 species of coral and thousands of species of fish, offering some of the
        world's best snorkelling and diving - particularly in the dry season (May - October), which isn't just one of the best times to visit Bali overall, but it's when the water has the best visibility.
      </p>
      <p>Here are three of the best snorkelling and diving spots in Bali, and why you should visit.</p>
      <h4>Tulamben</h4>
      <p>
        Beyond Tulamben's diverse marine life (Clownfish, Angelfish, sea turtles and reef sharks are just the tip of the iceberg!), it also offers incredibly unique underwater scenery. Explore the wreckage of the USS Liberty cargo ship,
        which was torpedoed in World War II, and swim through underwater art installations, like the Underwater Buddha and the Guardian of the Reef statues.
      </p>
      <h4>Nusa Penida</h4>
      <p>
        Nusa Penida offers rich marine life, colorful corals, and unique topography, making it one of the best diving and snorkeling sites in Bali. Spot the famous Mola Mola at Crystal Bay between August and October, or see majestic Manta
        Rays up close at the Manta Point cleaning station. Divers and snorkelers can also explore nearby Toyapakeh, Gamat Bay, SD Point, and Blue Corner for diverse underwater ecosystems.
      </p>
      <h4>Amed Beach</h4>
      <p>
        For a more peaceful and tranquil diving and snorkelling experience, Amed Beach offers a secluded spot that's perfect for beginners. Divers and snorkelers can expect to spot the Hawksbill Sea Turtle, Parrotfish, Angelfish, Clownfish,
        and Octopuses while in the water. The area also boasts stunning views of Mount Agung from the beach, and visitors can explore nearby spots like Jemeluk Bay and the Japanese Wreck.

      <p>
        Boasting its position as the number one spa in Nusa Dua, Zahra Spa is a vibrant and colourful multi-level facility offering high-quality treatments and soothing therapies to help you unwind and relax. Book into one of the decadent
        couple's packages or steal away for an indulgent Four-Hand Massage. Even better? Free transfers will take away the stress of transport.

      <img class="img-fluid" src="/assets/img/15.png" />
      <p class="mt-4">
        With such a rich heritage in spirituality and wellness, it’s no wonder that yoga is one of the most popular activities to do in Bali. From Hatha and Vinyasa to Ashtanga and Yin, beginners and yogis alike will have no issue finding a
        retreat or studio to Downward Dog.

      </p>
      <h4>Yoga 108, Seminyak</h4>

      <h3>6. Learn to surf</h3>
      <img class="img-fluid" src="/assets/img/16.png" />
      <p class="mt-4">
        Surfing isn’t just a sport in Bali, it’s a way of life. While experienced surfers and pros flock to the world-class waves at Uluwatu and Padang Padang, Bali has enough beaches and breaks for all skill levels, making it easy and
        enjoyable to learn to surf with experienced instructors while visiting.
      </p>
      <p>Here are three of the best beaches in Bali to learn how to surf:</p>
      <h4>Padang Padang</h4>
      <p>
        Padang Padang Beach in the Bukit Peninsula is famous for reef breaks that produce powerful, barreling waves. It may be too challenging for beginners, but it’s a great spot to take your surfing skills to the next level. There are a
        number of surfing schools in the area, and instructors who can guide you to the best spot to surf and help improve your abilities safely.
      </p>
      <h4>Dreamland</h4>
      <p>
        Beginners looking for an easy spot to learn to surf that isn’t too intimidating should make their way to the lively beach of Dreamland in the Bukit Pensisula. The waves are known to be generally smaller, gentler, and easier to ride
        compared to more challenging surf spots, and there are several schools and instructors to help you find your surf legs.
      </p>
      <h4>Kuta</h4>
      <p>
        Bustling Kuta Beach is more than just a spot to sunbathe or enjoy the nightlife. Offering a wide range of surfing conditions, it’s a great place for beginners to learn or to upskill to more advanced levels. Surf schools in the area
        offer one-on-one sessions or group lessons and can provide all that you need, too, including surfboards, leashes and rash vests.

      <p>Three of the best beach clubs in Bali are Sundays Beach Club, Potato Head and Finns.</p>
      <h4>Sundays Beach Club, Ungasan, near Uluwatu</h4>
      <p>
        Take a break from sightseeing in Uluwatu and travel about 20 minutes to set yourself up at Sundays Beach Club for the day. With its pristine white sand and crystal-clear lagoon, it has something for all ages. Relax on a bean bag,
        watch the sunset to a live DJ set, or take advantage of the complimentary kayaks, snorkel gear and paddleboards. For the ultimate indulgence, book a VIP package.

      <img class="img-fluid" src="/assets/img/18.png" />
      <p class="mt-4">Bali may be Indonesia's most popular island, but there are at least seven small islands nearby that offer their own unique cultural charm and natural beauty.</p>
      <p>Nusa Penida, Gili Trawangan and Lombok are three of the best islands around Bali. Below is more information on why they’re worth visiting.</p>
      <h4>Nusa Penida</h4>
      <p>

        Zipping around Bali on a scooter is one of the most popular and cost-effective ways to get around and experience the island's natural beauty. Renting a scooter is easy. If you don’t organise it on arrival at Ngurah Rai International
        Airport, you can sort out your scooter at one of the many rental shops and hotels. Prices range from IDR75,000 (~AUD$7.50) to IDR 300,000 (~ AUD$30) per day, depending on where you’re renting the scooter, the type of scooter and the
        length of time you’ll need the rental. However, it's important to keep in mind that traffic in Bali can be chaotic, and road rules are often not followed. You’ll also need an international driver’s license to legally rent a scooter.
        It's recommended to wear a helmet, avoid driving at night, and be cautious on narrow roads. Additionally, it's important to have valid travel insurance and make sure your rental includes third-party insurance. Ride-sharing apps such
        as Go-Jek and Grab also offer scooter rentals with insurance included.
